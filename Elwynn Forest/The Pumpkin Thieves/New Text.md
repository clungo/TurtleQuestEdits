<h1>Description</h1>  

This is outrageous! The nerve!  

First, these gnolls were out sneaking and startling our herds. Now they're sneakin into our barn. What's next!? Robbing our houses? Killing us in our sleep!?  

These gnolls are getting bolder with each week and we need our fields protected! But the guards will do nothing! You look like a capable fighter. Perhaps you'll be able to help me and get something out of it yourself.

I tell you, these gnolls have been stealing my pumpkins! Of course, I doubt they could do more than char them over a campfire. They have no idea what you could make out of our sweet pumpkins! Barbarians!

Last I've saw these mongrels they were fleeing toward Goldshire. I doubt guards will be of any help on this matter. Perhaps someone at the Eastvale Logging Camp could help with our troubleâ€¦
  
<h1>Progress</h1>
Oh, tell me you have managed to find my harvest! At least 15 of my sweet pumpkins?

<h1>Completion</h1>
By the Light! My dear child, you have no idea what you have truly done for us all here on our farm! You have my deepest gratitude and respect, <name>!
