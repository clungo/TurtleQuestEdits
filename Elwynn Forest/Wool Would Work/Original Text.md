<h1>Description</h1>  
I know that it's not always warm around the world and sometimes when it's winter setting on the fields mommy used to make us soft and warm mittens and gloves. I remember my cape when we had only Lulu. it was made with her wool. If was so soft and warm! I can make you one too! But before I do that I need some more wool from our sheeps here. As you can see we don't have a lot of them around right now. Why don't you gather some wool from them around the Elwynn? If you have about 20 flocks then I could make you a long drape which will be soft and warm!  
  
  
<h1>Progress</h1>
If you gather enough wool I can make you a long, warm and very comfortable drape.  

<h1>Completion</h1>
Amazing, <name>! You've done it!
