<h1>Description</h1>  

Not everywhere is as warm as around Goldshire.  

I grew up in farmin' in the fields of Lordaeron. In the winter, Mama would make mittens to keep our hands warm.

The first thing Mama ever made me was a cape my from Lulu's wool. It was so warm and soft!

I can make you one too! But we don't have enough sheep around here for the wool! Why don't you gather some wool from them around the Elwynn? Shave 20 flocks and I can make you a cape just like mine!

<h1>Progress</h1>
Were you able to find enough wool?  

<h1>Completion</h1>
Amazing, <name>! You've done it!
